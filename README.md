"""
This repository contains the excerises based on what we covered in Session 2. The excersises are as follow: 

Exercise 1: FizzBuzz

1. Write a FizzBuzz Function: Create a function fizzbuzz(n) that takes an integer n as a parameter.
   
2. Implement FizzBuzz Logic: The function should print:

○ "Fizz" for multiples of 3
○ "Buzz" for multiples of 5
○ "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5
○ The number itself for other numbers

3. Call the Function: Call the function for numbers 1 to 20.


Exercise 2: Basic Data Filtering

1. Create a List of Mixed Data Types: Create a list that contains a mix of integers, strings, and floats.
2. Filter the List: Use list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the integers from the original list.
3. Print the New List: Output the filtered list of integers.


Exercise 3: Simple To-Do List

1. Create an Empty List: Start with an empty list called todo_list.
2. Define Functions:
○ A function add_task(task) that adds a task to the list.
○ A function show_tasks() that prints all tasks in the list.


Exercise 4: Temperature Converter

1. Define a Conversion Function: Write a function celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius) that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
2. Print the Result: Output the converted temperature for 22ºF, 46ºF, 51ºF and 76ºF
